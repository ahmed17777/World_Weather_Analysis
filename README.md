## Overview 

In this project, I will be using Google APIs to pull weather data for different vacation locations and identifying potential travel destinations and nearby hotels based on weather preferences for Jack. A four city itinerary will be created and mapped using Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route between the four cities. 

## Vacation Map 
The following is a vacation map made using Pandas and OpenWeather API. It returns potential vacation cities that have a temperature range of 75 to 85F.

## Vacation Itinerary 
Based on Jack's preferences, a vacation itinerary map is made that includes a road trip between four cities: Acapulco, Tecoanapa, Puerto Escondido, and Pochutla in Mexico. The itinerary map is made using Google's Directions API.
